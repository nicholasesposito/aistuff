1. sub3, sub4, sub5, are sub2mem_mer.f in order
   They have been merged. Needs some review and some comments

2. input1 through input5 are pspl.f90 in order.
   Merged into pspl_merged.py 
   input1 is somewhat reviewed though I'm not sure if I'm doing it 
      correctly. Also all need comments.

3. orders.f is from NCEPLIBS-w3emc
https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-w3emc/blob/develop/src/orders.f
   Somewhat converted but I don't like the new output. 
   Maybe redo with codeconvertai.
   For now, it's in orders.py
