1. sub3, sub4, sub5, are sub2mem_mer.f in order
   They have been merged. Needs some review and some comments

2. input1 through input5 are pspl.f90 in order.
   They have not been merged yet.
   input1 is somewhat reviewed though I'm not sure if I'm doing it 
      correctly. Also all need comments.

3. orders.f is from NCEPLIBS-w3emc
https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-w3emc/blob/develop/src/orders.f
   Has not been converted to python yet.
